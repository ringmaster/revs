# Revs
A plugin for Habari that displays post revisions in a tray on the post editing page.

## How it Works

Habari's core capaibilities automatically keeps revisions of the core data fields as they're saved.  But Habari provides no means to display those revisions.

This plugin provides all of the key revisions by date and allows you to select a revision.  When a revision is selected, the data for that revision is loaded into the post publishing form.  At that point, the data can be reviewed, or even re-published as the latest revision.
